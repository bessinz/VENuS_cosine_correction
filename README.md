# VENuS_cosine_correction

### Description
 This code is used to process a cosine correction on VENµS (Vegetation and Environment New Micro Satellite) SRE (Surface REflectance) product using the 8-m HMA (High Mountain Asia) DEM (Digital Elevation Model); improve the CNES CLM_XS cloud mask (cloud shadows are not included in this mask) and 
 compute SCA (Snow Cover Area) maps in the Khumbu valley (Nepal).

### Installation
 This code has been developed on Python 3 using Linux. A Windows version will follow.
